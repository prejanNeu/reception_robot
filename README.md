# Presidential Graduate School App

This is a simple Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed for the Presidential Graduate School. The app allows users to navigate through various sections of the school such as **Courses**, **Faculty**, **Clubs**, and **Contact**. Each section is displayed on a separate window with interactive buttons and images, and users can navigate back to the main page using an arrow button.

## Features

- **Main Window**: Displays a background image with buttons for the available sections (Courses, Faculty, Clubs, Contact).
- **Navigation**: Clicking a section button opens a new window with a corresponding image and an arrow button to return to the main window.
- **Responsive Design**: The images and buttons adjust their size to fit the window dimensions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Pillow (`PIL`) for image handling

To install Pillow, run:
```bash
pip install pillow
```


## How to Run
Ensure that you have all the image files (arrow.jpeg, background.jpg, course.jpeg, club.jpeg, faculty.jpeg, contact.jpeg, 1.jpeg, 2.jpeg, 3.jpeg, and 4.jpeg) in the same directory as the script.
Install Python 3.x and the required packages (Tkinter and Pillow).
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python app.py
```
